# TextWorld

An experiment in creating a text based role playing adventure game using a
custom Entity Component System.

## Status

Still in the process of being implemented. The current user interface is console
based.

There are two implementations, one in C# and the other in C++. The one being
actively developed currently is the C++ implementation.
