# TextWorld

An experiment in creating a text based adventure game

## Status

Nothing really substantial here yet. I'm going to be dumping a bunch of code in
the `misc` folder for now that is basically unfinished experiments that deal
with the text based game subject. The code is only pieces of other larger
codebases that were never finished.

I've started and stopped this exercise many times and never completed. The
overall idea this time is to get something basic going and finish it. I hope to
build up some momentum that will allow me to continue on with other more
elaborate projects.
