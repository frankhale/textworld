# TextWorld

An experiment in creating a text based role playing adventure game using a custom Entity 
Component System.

## Status

Basic game play is implemented. Basic NPC interaction is implemented but all you can do is talk 
to them right now. Player can move around the world, pick up items, use items, drop items. Still
need to do some work to add more game play elements.
